Hey there!

This is my first blog post on my new website. This is the third iteration of my website, which I like to call rossevansgames.com 3.0.

For a bit of history 1.0 was built in October of 2014. This was a static site made in pure HTML and CSS, made to exclusively show off my projects.

The 2.0 redesign occurred in August of 2015 - it gave the website a more professional look while also adding a blog hosted through Tumblr. This site used PHP to fetch and display the tumblr posts, jQuery to animate scrolling, and iFrames to display projects.
Although this had been the defacto rossevansgames.com front page for a long time, it lacked a lot - there was no responsive design and load times were enormous due to a scrolling image background. Additionally, since I made it a _single page application_, there was no ability to link to individual parts of the webpage.

3.0 (what you're looking at now!) was built in June of 2018. This version of the website uses React, along with a simple markdown blog system that I wrote to avoid the peril's of Tumblr's API (as well as the fact that a site this simple shouldn't need a backend).

This is also the first version of the website where the source is easily accessible online, you can find it [hosted on my GitHub](https://github.com/Qcode/Portfolio).

I hope to keep this place updated fairly regularly with the projects and programming things I'm working on at the moment.

Until next time!`,
