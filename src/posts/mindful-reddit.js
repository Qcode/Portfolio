The first draft of my newest project is here - it's called [mindfulreddit](https://mindfulreddit.rossevans.ca/).

Mindfulreddit is a reddit aggregator that focuses on tempering the endless stream of information that Reddit provides.
I wrote more about the motivation for creating this project on the [about page](https://mindfulreddit.rossevans.ca/about),
but in short, I desired a way to keep the likeable parts of Reddit while mitigating its ability to so thoroughly capture my attention.
Earlier this year I watched [a video from Hank Green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_942GMxf98) which I highly recommend -
until watching it I had never fully considered the degree to which the content I consume can shape my daily mood.
This video was a large inspiration for the creation of the site; it provided me with the desire to regain control over the information I consider in the day to day.

mindfulreddit limits an individual to choosing three subreddits they want to see.
Upon completing this form, they're presented three posts from each subreddit with the three top comments from each post.
The site continues displaying this content for three hours, in order to prevent the easily developed cycle of repeatedly checking for updates.

The site is hosted at [mindfulreddit.rossevans.ca](https://mindfulreddit.rossevans.ca/), and [the source is available on GitHub](https://github.com/Qcode/mindfulreddit).
Updates may come in the future - I'll see what I think might be worthwhile after making it part of my daily routine.`,
